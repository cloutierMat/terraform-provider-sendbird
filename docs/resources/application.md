<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Specifies the unique name of the application. This parameter is case-insensitive. While this value could change without replacing the application, Sendbird isn't exposing an API to modify the name. If a name change is required, it is possible to change the value on the console and in the configuration. The next terraform apply will appropriately detect the change and won't replace the application
- `region_key` (String) Specifies the code of the region. Acceptable values are listed on the [Sendbird Dashboard](https://dashboard.sendbird.com/auth/signin) under Organization settings > General > API Key > Regions.

### Read-Only

- `api_token` (String, Sensitive) Master API Token. To be authenticated by Sendbird server, your request should include one of the listed API tokens. For further information, see the Authentication page in the [documentation](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/platform-api/v3/prepare-to-use-api#2-authentication)
- `created_at` (String) Application creation timestamp. Format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ
- `id` (String) Application id generated by Sendbird.
- `region_name` (String) User friendly name for the region.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import sendbird_application.example APPLICATION_ID
```
